### Comprehensive Plan to Address Registration Errors

1. **Review Password Handling**:
   - Ensure that the password is being hashed correctly when saving the user. This involves using `set_password()` properly in the views.

2. **Form Validation**:
   - Implement error handling in the views to check if the forms are valid. If not, return the form with error messages to the user. This will help identify any issues with the input data.

3. **Redirect Logic**:
   - Confirm that the redirect after successful registration is functioning correctly. Ensure that the user is redirected to the appropriate login page after registration.

4. **Testing**:
   - After making the necessary changes, test the registration process for each user type (admin, doctor, patient) to ensure that it works without errors.

5. **Error Logging**:
   - Consider adding logging to capture any exceptions or errors that occur during the registration process. This will help in diagnosing issues in the future.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Implement the changes in the `views.py` and `forms.py` files as needed.
- Test the registration process thoroughly to ensure that all user types can register without errors.
